A £2m renovation in 2012 was intended to give it another decade of use.</p>\n        <p>However, there is some scepticism about how long it will take to build a new venue, and how it will turn out.</p>\n        <p>\"I don't want an arts centre,\" Taylor said - as if these were dirty words - to cheers from the audience on Friday.</p>\n        <p>He and other supporters are still holding out a slim hope of saving the current building.</p>\n        <p>\"I'm not an architect, but I see old buildings restored,\" he continued. \"They say this building's not fit for purpose. Well restore it then!\"</p>\n        "

His office said he died on Tuesday.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        He starred in the film Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence with David Bowie in 1983.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        His film score for The Last Emperor, in 1987, won him an Oscar, a Grammy and a Golden Globe. He also acted in the movie, an epic about the life of Puyi, last emperor of China.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Sakamoto began studying composition at the age of 10 and was inspired by the Beatles and Debussy.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        He set up YMO with Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi in 1978, playing keyboards, and their synthesizer innovations influenced techno-pop and hip-hop.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"Asian music heavily influenced Debussy, and Debussy heavily influenced me.

But I always wanted to break it, break the wall, or limits I am trapped inside. Sometimes using electronics or blending with electronic sound can help to break this wall.\"\n        <p>\n        He also enjoyed exploring various musical styles. \"After I wake up I start thinking, hmm, which music will I listen to,\" he said. \"Sometimes by chance or randomly, you know, some music comes to my mind. To me there is no genre difference, or category differences. Music is music.\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        In Japan he was also famous as an environmental campaigner, especially after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Born in 1952, his father was a literary editor for Japanese writers including Nobel laureate Kenzaburo Oe. As a student he was classically trained but later specialised in ethnomusicology at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music. He was fascinated by world music, including that of Okinawa island in Japan.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        His later collaborations included work with Brian Eno, Alva Noto and cellist Jaques Morelenbaum.

The time signature appears to shift and the scale drifts in and out of familiarity.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        The sound of the pioneering pianist reflected the way her life oscillated between parallel worlds.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        She was trained in Western classical music but was equally the product of traditional Orthodox Christian chants and tunes.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Her unique musical voice led one critic, Kate Molleson, to argue that Emahoy should be included alongside more familiar names when considering great 20th Century composers.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        As a young person, Emahoy was a free-spirited modern woman but she spent much of her later life as a reclusive.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        She became a devout nun who lived a humble life in a monastery in a remote part of her country. But in an earlier time she had moved in the high society of the capital, Addis Ababa, where she performed in the court of the country's last Emperor, Haileselassie I.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Most of her important musical works - recognisable in their complexity and apparent effortlessness - came in the 1960s and 1970s.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        This was during a time when her contemporaries in Addis Ababa were blending Western beats with the Ethiopian pentatonic - or five-note - scale to create a unique fusion of sounds and styles that would later be dubbed Ethio-jazz.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        The genre is marked by shuffling soul and funky music as well as big-band swing pieces.\n        <p>\n        But Emahoy's compositions and style were distinct. They were just her and her piano producing an intimate, meditative - and unsettling - melancholy informed by a fascinating life punctuated by the momentous events her country experienced during the last century.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        She was born in Addis Ababa in December 1923 into a prominent aristocratic family. Her father was a mayor of the historical city of Gondar in the country's north.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Her given name was Yewubdar - Amharic for \"the most beautiful one\"- a name she used until she was ordained as a nun at the age of 21.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        And with her family came privilege and opportunities.\n        </p> \n        <p>\n        As a child she was sent to Switzerland with her sister - the first Ethiopian girls to have been sent abroad for education. It was in a Swiss boarding school that she first encountered Western classical music and at the age of eight began playing violin and the piano.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        In Europe she felt alienated. \"Loneliness grew up with me like a childhood friend,\" she said in a book about her father's life written by her brother, Dawit Gebru.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Music was her consolation.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Upon her return to Ethiopia at the age of 11 she was already an outgoing young girl with an appetite for fashion. But then war and tragedy knocked.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        In 1936 Benito Mussolini's Italy invaded Ethiopia. Three members of her family were killed and she was forced into exile on an island in the Mediterranean. The killing of her relatives left a strong impression on her - later she would compose a song, The Ballad of the Spirits, in their memory.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        After five years of occupation, the Italians left Ethiopia and Emahoy returned home where she began work at the ministry of foreign affairs - the first female secretary there. And she drove cars - a rarity for a woman - when the majority of Ethiopians used a horse and cart for travel.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        She was determined that her gender would not get in the way.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"Even in my teenage [years] I would say: 'What is the difference between boys and girls? They are equal,\" she told music journalist Molleson for a 2017 BBC documentary about her life.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        A few years later she was once again on road.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        This time to the Egyptian capital, Cairo, to study music under the Polish violinist Alexander Kontorowicz.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        She practised nine hours a day but it was the searing heat that she could not handle. As a consequence, she returned to the cooler climes of Addis Ababa with her teacher, who was appointed the head of the Imperial Guard Band.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        While she seemed to enjoy the favours of the emperor for whom she played her music, not all in the aristocratic class were impressed. So when she was given the chance to continue her studies at the Royal Academy of Music in London, she was not permitted to travel - a decision for which her family blame some senior officials.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        It changed the trajectory of her life.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Emahoy was heartbroken and sick to the point of being admitted to hospital. Subsequently she took a deep dive into religion. Eventually, she abandoned music - and the city - for a hilltop monastery in a remote part of northern Ethiopia.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        She became a nun, shaved her head and stopped wearing shoes.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        The death of the monastic community's archbishop and problems with the soles of her feet led her to return to the capital in her 30s after 10 years of isolation, Molleson says.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        She resumed playing music. She continued to shun the spotlight but her compositions took off around this time.\n        </p>\n        "

It's a scale thing,\" says Steve Davidson, chief operating officer at Sunderland AFC.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"The cost of putting on these big worldwide tours is enormous, so they [artists] have to sell out bigger venues in order to make it pay,\" he adds.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Mr Davidson says the Stadium of Light can hold 60,000 people at a typical concert, which has helped attract artists like Beyoncé and Pink to the north-east of England this summer.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"We've got space and we're in the city centre. That's attractive to [concert] promoters,\" Mr Davidson says.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        He also notes that artists are putting more effort into staging and production, which on a basic level means travelling with lots and lots of trucks.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"Some artists are coming with 90 HGV trucks - we've got space to host them all,\" he adds.\n        <p>\n        Beyoncé fans have been predicting online that her Renaissance World Tour stage could be an estimated 174ft (53m) wide and 84ft long, excluding its runway and additional smaller stage.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Compare this with her last arena tour in 2013, when the main stage was less than half the size of her predicted stadium one - 76ft by 49ft.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        So not only would an arena not have enough room to accommodate all those trucks, the stage would also be too big too\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"They have to go from one venue to another and be in and out really quickly - that saves them money,\" Steve adds\n        </p> \n        <p>\n        But with bigger tours, comes bigger risks, says Wembley's stadium director Liam Boylan.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"There's a lot of pressure,\" he tells the BBC. \"It's a big gamble for promoters because everything's bigger: More trucks, more crew, more equipment.\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Promoters are responsible for organising live events and making sure tickets sell. They have to weigh up whether the interest in a particular artist is high enough to fill the seats.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"Promoters will say 'I'm going to guarantee you so much money', but if a show doesn't sell, they're liable,\" Mr Boylan adds.\n        </p>\n        <h3>'Demand is huge'</h3>\n        <p>\n        John Cornwell has worked as a music promoter for more than 25 years, putting tours on for artists like Muse, Blink 182 and Kings of Leon. It was his job to work out where the Arctic Monkeys would appear in the UK this summer as they embark on a full stadium tour.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"Demand for the band is huge. We've sold 500,000 tickets in England and Wales alone,\" he tells the BBC.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        The Glastonbury headliners will be stopping by Bristol City's Ashton Gate Stadium, Norwich City's Carrow Road Stadium and Middlesborough FC's Riverside Stadium - three towns and cities that don't currently have arena venues.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"We wanted as many fans to be able to see the band and take the tour to as many areas of the country, not just Sheffield, London and Manchester,\" he adds.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        He also says stadiums allow more freedom for artists' production teams, who can \"design the staging and sound to achieve the best possible experience for fans in each venue\".\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"The positioning of sound systems, for example, can be tailored to each venue's particular acoustics,\" he adds.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        But the main drawback of touring in stadiums is that an artist only has a small window of time to choose from. Concerts cannot interfere with the venues' main business: sport.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"Trying to fit [concerts] into the calendar is tricky because they will kill a football pitch,\" Mr Boylan says.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        He says Beyoncé's team wanted Wembley, but her suggested tour dates clashed with the FA Cup.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"With people doing a stadium tour, they tend to be on a world tour so their manager and agent have this huge jigsaw puzzle to solve.\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        His team's solution has been to increase the number of concerts that can take place per year from 16 to 24, to help accommodate more touring artists.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Stadium tours show no signs of stopping, but Steve Davidson says he is \"genuinely worried about some of the promoter pricing\".\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"We don't determine the general admission ticket prices, which are often over £100. Our match-day tickets are £29 - that's a massive difference,\" he says.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        He adds that, even though shows provide a huge boost in trade around Sunderland, promoters need to be reminded that \"there's less disposable income here than in London\".\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Mr Boylan says Wembley Stadium has been affected by increased energy costs, which means the price of renting the venue increases and consumers can end up picking up the bill.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"As a venue operator you are concerned about disposable income and you don't want to outprice people, but you have to cover your costs,\" he says.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"We're very aware of what's going on in the world and what people have to put up with.\"\n        </p>\n        "

Beverley Knight compares herself with John Cleese</h3>\n        <p>\n        Knight looked amazing when she arrived in head-to-toe black latex adorned with gold snakes - she even had someone carrying the back of her dress, so it didn't drag on the grassy, sustainable green carpet.\n        <p>\n        She sang twice during the ceremony, for suffragette musical Sylvia - which won her an Olivier - and also for Sister Act, about a singer who goes into witness protection by pretending to be a nun.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        That's a lot of costume changes - how did she manage it? With precision timing.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"I literally am like John Cleese in the film Clockwise [a film about an obsessively punctual headmaster], minute by minute, in wigs, and in and out of costumes,\" she said.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        It's a good job Cleese's headmaster stuck to wearing suits in the film - if he'd had to change from black latex into a nun's habit, he'd definitely have been late.\n        </p> \n        <h3>3. Liz Carr wore a winning monologue</h3>\n        <p>\n        Last year's best supporting actress winner Liz Carr was in a stunning outfit and, if you look closely, you'll see her pink bolero top is adorned with words.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        It turns out that Carr thinks she may have won in 2022 because she delivered a powerful monologue by her character, Dr Emma Brookner, in The Normal Heart.\n        <p>\n        So the Silent Witness star decided that, this year, she'd wear the speech, which was \"very dear to my heart\".\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        She also tweeted about the fact that, for the first time, the awards stage was wheelchair accessible, telling us: \"This year the ramp is incredible.\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Carr added how excited she was for her upcoming role in the second series of BBC Two's Good Omens, which will also feature Sir Derek Jacobi, who was at the Oliviers for his lifetime achievement award.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        She's also going to appear in the third season of Netflix's series The Witcher, and said: \"I'm getting smaller roles, but in bigger things, since I won last year - but no theatre work. I'm desperate to tread the boards again.\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Casting directors, take note.\n        </p>\n        <h3>4. Hey Duggee live is like a 'rave for under-fives'</h3>\n        <p>\n        Hey Duggee, the hugely popular CBeebies show, successfully transferred to the stage and won the Olivier for best family show..\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Matthew Xia and Vikki Stone, who adapted the TV show about Duggee - the leader of The Squirrel Club - for live performances, told us it was a \"category that can often get a bit lost in the mix\".\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"Children's theatre is really important, it's where formative opinions are made, and we feel really passionate about it,\" they said.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Xia described it as a \"mosh pit down at the front of the South Bank Centre, with loads of two-year-olds raving like their lives depended on it\".\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Stone added: \"It's banging - it's genuinely the sort of system you'd put into a massive concert. So the parents, who were probably partying in the 90s and early 2000s, can get a sense of that - but with their under-fives - all at safe levels.\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        If you're missing your raving days since having children, this might possibly help bridge the gap. Maybe.\n        </p>\n        <h3>5. Mark Strong on why 'real talent' is required for theatre'</h3>\n        <p>\n        The stage and screen actor, who won a best actor Olivier in 2015 for A View From a Bridge, spoke to us about why he thinks the Oliviers are so special.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        They're for people who have \"earned their spurs doing something incredibly difficult\", Strong says. \"Real talent is required\".\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"I think stage is the yardstick you measure yourself against, and if you can carry a play over the course of an evening - beginning, middle and an end and moving audience - then I think that's incredibly important.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"I think I've been more moved in live theatre than I've ever been in a movie theatre,\" he adds.\n        </p>\n        <h3>6. Arthur Darvill on why there's room for musicals</h3>\n        <p>\n        Darvill, who won best actor in a musical, for Oklahoma!, said he thought its revival had been so popular because \"it's about what people do for love, and how they come together to create a community\".\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        But what about playwright David Hare saying recently that \"musicals have become the leylandii of theatre, strangling everything in their path\"? Andrew Lloyd Webber certainly disagreed with him.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"Well, I don't want to say too much,\" says Darvill, but he does add: \"I doubt he's seen our show because I don't think musicals are strangling theatre. I think there's room for everything.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"There should be more plays on in the West End, but I don't think it's because specifically our show is taking the place of one.\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        The former Doctor Who star also talks about the return under Russell T Davies of David Tennant, before Ncuti Gatwa takes on the role.\n        </p>\n        \"It's such a wonderful family to be part of, I just love seeing how it changes and evolves. I'm excited for Ncuti, because I think he's going to have such a great time,\" he says.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        \"You become part of something that will be with you for the rest of your life. And that's really special.\"\n        </p>\n        <h3>7. Tim Minchin did a sketch with Prince Charles</h3>\n        </p>\n        \"I love British theatre,\" says the award-winning Matilda composer and lyricist Tim Minchin, adding that he thinks it has a \"very different vibe from across the pond\".\n        </p>\n        </p>\n        Given he's sung at previous Royal Variety Performances, is he going to be involved in the upcoming coronation for King Charles?\n         </p>\n        </p>\n        \"I'm not sure you'd get me,\" he laughs, but then tells us he did appear in a 2017 spoof Hamlet sketch celebrating Shakespeare, with none other than Prince Charles, as he was then known.\n        </p>\n        </p>\n        \"Look it up,\" he says, and so we do, only to discover it also featured Sir Ian McKellen, Dame Judi Dench, Benedict Cumberbatch, David Tennant, Paapa Essiedu, Harriet Walter and Rory Kinnear.\n        </p>\n        </p>\n        \"Yeah, it was a pretty star-studded sketch,\" he recalls with a grin. Having watched it, we can see why it made him smile.\n        </p>\n        "

Now it's happened, how are they responding?\n         </b></p>\n         <p>The news of Trump's criminal charges spread like wildfire online but getting a complete sense of the conversations reacting to it can be hard.</p>\n        <p>By getting inside US voters' social media feeds and joining the internet groups populated with Trump's most devoted fans, we can better see how all of this is unfolding.</p>\n        <p>That's where the BBC's \"undercover voters\" come in - social media accounts belonging to five fictional characters from across the US political spectrum, based on data from Pew Research.</p>\n        <p>These five profiles give us a snapshot of what US voters are seeing on social media, both on mainstream platforms and in the recesses out of the reach of most of us.</p>\n        <p>After searching for Trump-related material on their feeds, three key themes emerge.</p>\n        <h3>Trump supporters 'sick to the stomach'</h3>\n         <p>Let's start with the mainstream, right-wing profiles.</p>\n         <p>For our right-leaning voters Britney and Larry, their feeds are dominated by pro-Trump messages.</p>\n        <p>Echoing the language of the former president, there are defiant statements about a \"witch hunt\" and how Democrats have \"weaponised the legal system\".</p>\n        <p>These include tweets from Republican politicians, commentators and other pro-Trump accounts who are using this as a rallying call for his 2024 presidential bid.</p>\n        <p>Some accounts call for him to be reinstalled to the White House now and there is talk of supporters feeling sick to their stomachs.</p>\n        <p>News of the indictment has largely drowned out mention of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who could be Mr Trump's biggest Republican rival if he runs.</p>\n        <p>That includes on our apolitical voter Gabriela's feeds, where he's been a key character in recent months.</p>\n        <p>Instead, she is receiving lots of posts supportive of Mr Trump and claiming this indictment is an \"unjust\" attempt to thwart his presidential bid.</p>\n        <p>Unlike Trump's original post on Truth Social predicting his arrest, which called for protests, the posts these accounts are seeing have generally avoided direct calls to action.</p>\n        <h3>'Trust the plan'</h3>\n        <p>On the sites like Telegram where Trump's most committed devotees gather, there's a different mood.</p>\n         <p>This is where the sprawling, unfounded QAnon conspiracy theory thrives - it says the former president is waging a secret war against elite, Satan-worshipping paedophiles in government, business and the media.</p>\n        <p>True to that, there's much chatter of how the indictment is part of a plot by the so-called Deep State.</p>\n         <p>There are two competing narratives unfolding simultaneously in these channels.</p>\n        <p>The first involves angry and sometimes violent rhetoric directed at the government, along with cryptic calls to action. Messages include \"Here We Go!!\" and \"Their turn is coming soon\".</p>\n        <p>Others refer to false claims the 2020 election was rigged and Trump was the rightful winner, explaining \"see if we'll stand against this fake government should Trump [be] arrested\".</p>\n        <p>The more extreme messages call for followers to \"Kill the Deep State\" but there is no visible evidence of plans to riot.</p>\n        <p>There is talk of pro-Trump rallies but the mood feels different to the US Capitol riots which was preceded by a social media movement rife with hateful language and calls for violent action.</p>\n        <p>The difference now could in part be explained by the other narrative swirling in these online circles - stay off the streets.</p>\n        <p>Several posting on Telegram fear there is a sinister plot enticing them to take action and be arrested. They say there is a bigger plan where Trump will emerge victorious - if they can stay out of trouble.</p>\n        <p>They've just made Trump the most \"prolific political martyr in history\", one writes.</p>\n        <p>While the chatter on the main channels seems to be absent of specific calls to arms, there are smaller, private groups we cannot see where a very committed few could pose the greater risk. </p>\n        <h3>'Trust the plan'</h3>\n        <p>Trump's indictment is a huge topic of conversation on the left too.</p>\n        <p>Memes showing Trump in a prison jumpsuit behind bars appear at the top of the left-leaning voters' feeds, moments after the news breaks.</p>\n        <p>Posts targeting the profiles belonging to Emma and Michael are celebrating his imminent arrest - several remark how \"no-one is above the law\". But there are some niggling doubts too.</p>\n        <p>Several posts question whether Trump is being indicted for the right crime, given the gravity of other investigations he faces.</p>\n        <p>And some say that the way his base and the wider Republican Party are rallying to him could boost his presidential campaign. There are posts fearing the indictment will \"backfire\" by rousing support from those who might otherwise have been less committed.</p>\n        <p>But the conversation isn't all about Trump on the left. Within a few hours of the indictment news, other issues like trans rights and criticism of Ron DeSantis start to creep in too.</p>\n        <p>Where can you keep up with the Undercover Voters?</p>\n        <p>Listen to Americast on BBC Sounds and tune into BBC 2's Newsnight for regular updates on what these profiles are recommended around major news events, and investigations into how they are targeted in the build-up to the 2024 election.</p>\n        "

      "content": "\n         <p><b>\n         This year's Electronic Entertainment Expo, the annual video game showcase known as E3, has been cancelled.\n         </b></p>\n         <p>It was due to return as an in-person event in Los Angeles for the first time in four years in June, but will not run in-person or online.</p>\n        <p>Analysts say it has \"struggled to remain relevant\" and adapt to changes in the industry in recent years.</p>\n        <p>Ubisoft became the latest publisher to pull out, while Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony were reportedly set to miss it.</p>\n        <p>Ubisoft told Video Game Chronicle it would livestream its own showcase instead of attending E3.</p>\n        <p>Since 1995 the event, operated by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), has gathered video game developers, publishers, fans and media from across the world to help hype hotly anticipated game and console launches.</p>\n        <p>Some large publishers have started hosting their own online events to tease new titles and tech alongside instead of gathering at an event like this with their competitors.</p>\n        <p>The console manufacturers have been a focal point in previous E3s, with seismic product reveals including the Xbox 360, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo DS.</p>\n        <p>E3 in the past - at its peak - was an attack on the senses.</p>\n        <p>There were neon lights, actors dressed up as video game characters strolling around giant halls, fans taking selfies by big statues, and people handing out T-shirts and encouraging you to try out their games.</p>\n        <p>It was so loud, with music blaring from every booth. It was different, but it created a buzz and atmosphere of excitement that the games industry hasn't matched since.</p>\n        <p>Leading developers in the past told me it was such an important event because it provided a week in the spotlight for the games industry.</p>\n        <p>When Keanu Reeves came out on stage a few years ago to announce that he was going to be in Cyberpunk 2077, it was a moment everybody talked about, and that's what E3 gave you.</p>\n        <p>It has also brought the global games industry together, and that's had a big spillover for smaller developers. If your stand was next door to Nintendo's presenting something like a new Mario game, people would check you out too.</p>\n        <p>Individual companies will still have events - with PlayStation, Nintendo and Ubisoft hosting their own shows. But it's never the same, because those companies are often speaking to people already converted to their products.</p>\n        <p>What E3 gave companies was an opportunity to cut through to new audiences and different people, and that could be lost. The long-term impact is unclear, but some people will certainly be mourning the loss of E3 this year.</p>\n        <p>That's not to say it won't come back eventually, but we must wait to see if it does and if it ever reaches its former peak.</p>\n        <h3>'A difficult decision'</h3>\n        <p>A notice on E3's website says its organisers, ReedPop and the ESA, will \"re-evaluate the future of E3\", but ReedPop has said they will still work together on future events.</p>\n        <p>The BBC has approached both companies for comment.</p>\n        <p>Gaming news site IGN said ESA members - which include Nintendo, Electronic Arts, Epic Games and Microsoft - had been informed of the cancellation by an email, which said this year's event had not attracted enough suitable interest.</p>\n        <p>Kyle Marsden-Kish, ReedPop's global vice-president of gaming, said it was \"a difficult decision\" but they had to do what was \"right for the industry\".</p>\n        <p>Remaining relevant</p>\n        <p>Piers Harding-Rolls, video game industry analyst at Ampere Analysis, told BBC News the cancellation reflected \"the declining relevance of a huge in-person trade show in the middle of June\".</p>\n        <p>He added that the event has \"struggled to remain relevant and reinvent itself\" in line with industry changes, including the growth of mobile gaming and the rise of more frequent digital-only showcases livestreamed online.</p>\n        "

The measures will apply to 23 types of equipment supplied by major technology companies including Tokyo Electron and Nikon. The exports affected will range from tools used to clean silicon wafers to immersion lithography machines, which use lasers to print patterns on silicon as part of the chip manufacturing process.</p>\n         <p>Semiconductors are at the centre of a dispute between the US and China, with China accusing the US of acting as a \"tech hegemony\" in response to Washington's export controls.

The policy will be subject to public comment, with plans to implement it in July.</p>\n         <p>Japanese trade minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said that the move was not coordinated with US restrictions, and that if exports were not being re-appropriated for military use, they would continue.

Suddenly, knowing all the streets in London had much less value - and so incumbent drivers experienced large wage cuts in response, of around 10% according to our research.</p>\n        <h3>'Pinch of salt'</h3>\n        <p>According to research cited by the report, 60% of workers are in occupations that did not exist in 1940.</p>\n        <p>But other research suggests technological change since the 1980s has displaced workers faster than it has created jobs.</p>\n        <p>And if generative AI is like previous information-technology advances, the report concludes, it could reduce employment in the near term.</p>\n        <p>The long-term impact of AI, however, was highly uncertain, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank Torsten Bell told BBC News, \"so all firm predictions should be taken with a very large pinch of salt\".</p>\n        <p>\"We do not know how the technology will evolve or how firms will integrate it into how they work,\" he said.</p>\n        <p>\"That's not to say that AI won't disrupt the way we work - but we should focus too on the potential living-standards gains from higher-productivity work and cheaper-to-run services, as well as the risk of falling behind if other firms and economies better adapt to technological change.\"</p>\n        "

But in a rare admission, Miami Police has confirmed to the BBC it uses this software for every type of crime.</p>\n         <p>Clearview's system allows a law enforcement customer to upload a photo of a face and find matches in a database of billions of images it has collected.</p>\n         <p>It then provides links to where matching images appear online. It is considered one of the most powerful and accurate facial recognition companies in the world.</p>\n         <p>The company is banned from selling its services to most US companies, after the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) took Clearview AI to court in Illinois for breaking privacy law.</p>\n         <p>But there is an exemption for police, and Mr Ton-That says his software is used by hundreds of police forces across the US.</p>\n         <p>Police in the US do not routinely reveal whether they use the software, and it is banned in several US cities including Portland, San Francisco and Seattle.</p>\n         <p>The use of facial recognition by the police is often sold to the public as only being used for serious or violent crimes.</p>\n         <p>In a rare interview with law enforcement about the effectiveness of Clearview, Miami Police said they used the software for every type of crime, from murders to shoplifting.</p>\n         <p>Assistant Chief of Police Armando Aguilar said his team used the system about 450 times a year, and that it had helped solve several murders.</p>\n         <p>However, critics say there are almost no laws around the use of facial recognition by police.</p>\n         <p>Mr Aguilar says Miami police treats facial recognition like a tip. \"We don't make an arrest because an algorithm tells us to,\" he says. \"We either put that name in a photographic line-up or we go about solving the case through traditional means.\"</p>\n         <h3>Mistaken identity</h3>\n         <p>There are a handful of documented cases of mistaken identity using facial recognition by the police. However, the lack of data and transparency around police use means the true figure is likely far higher.</p>\n        <p>Mr Ton-That says he is not aware of any cases of mistaken identity using Clearview. He accepts police have made wrongful arrests using facial recognition technology, but attributes those to \"poor policing\".</p>\n        <p>Clearview often points to research that shows it has a near 100% accuracy rate. But these figures are often based on mugshots.</p>\n        <p>In reality, the accuracy of Clearview depends on the quality of the image that is fed into it - something Mr Ton-That accepts.</p>\n        <p>Civil rights campaigners want police forces that use Clearview to openly say when it is used - and for its accuracy to be openly tested in court. They want the algorithm scrutinised by independent experts, and are sceptical of the company's claims.</p>\n        <p>Kaitlin Jackson is a criminal defence lawyer based in New York who campaigns against the police's use of facial recognition.</p>\n        <p>\"I think the truth is that the idea that this is incredibly accurate is wishful thinking,\" she says. \"There is no way to know that when you're using images in the wild like screengrabs from CCTV.\"</p>\n        <p>However, Mr Ton-That told the BBC he does not want to testify in court to its accuracy.</p>\n        <p>\"We don't really want to be in court testifying about the accuracy of the algorithm… because the investigators, they're using other methods to also verify it,\" he says.</p>\n        <p>Mr Ton-That says he has recently given Clearview's system to defence lawyers in specific cases. He believes that both prosecutors and defenders should have the same access to the technology.</p>\n        <p>Last year, Andrew Conlyn from Fort Myers, Florida, had charges against him dropped after Clearview was used to find a crucial witness.</p>\n        <p>Mr Conlyn was the passenger in a friend's car in March 2017 when it crashed into palm trees at high speed.</p>\n        <p>The driver was ejected from the car and killed. A passer-by pulled Mr Conlyn from the wreckage, but left without making a statement.</p>\n        <p>Although Mr Conlyn said he was the passenger, police suspected he had been driving and he he was charged with vehicular homicide.</p>\n        <p>His lawyers had an image of the passer-by from police body cam footage. Just before his trial, Mr Ton-That allowed Clearview to be used in the case.</p>\n        <p>\"This AI popped him up in like, three to five seconds,\" Mr Conlyn's defence lawyer, Christopher O'Brien, told the BBC. \"It was phenomenal.\"</p>\n        <p>The witness, Vince Ramirez, made a statement that he had taken Mr Conlyn out of the passenger's seat. Shortly after, the charges were dropped.</p>\n        <p>But even though there have been cases where Clearview is proven to have worked, some believe it comes at too high a price.</p>\n        <p>\"Clearview is a private company that is making face prints of people based on their photos online without their consent,\" says Mr Guariglia.</p>\n        <p>\"It's a huge problem for civil liberties and civil rights, and it absolutely needs to be banned.\"</p>\n        "

A lot has been written about the treatment of migrant workers who built the stadiums and hotels, but much less about the foreign maids who work for Qatar's ruling classes. On paper their rights have been strengthened in recent years - but the new rules aren't always followed.\n         </b></p>\n         <p>I make contact with Gladys (not her real name) late at night, after her employers from the Qatari elite have gone to bed.</p>\n        <p>In a brief online conversation she tells me she works from 8am to 11pm every day. She cleans, helps prepare food and looks after the children.</p>\n        <p>She eats what's left from the family's meals, and says she hasn't had a day off since she started 18 months ago.</p>\n        <p>\"Madam is crazy,\" Gladys, a Filipina woman in her 40s, says about her employer. \"She shouts at me every day.\"</p>\n        <p>Before Qatar won the competition to host the 2022 World Cup, foreign workers were unable to change jobs or leave the country without their employer's permission. It's still like this in most Gulf states.</p>\n        <p>Under scrutiny, Qatar began to introduce reforms, but Amnesty International says these have failed to end a pattern of abuses faced by domestic workers.</p>\n        <p>For example, Gladys's employer has held on to her passport, preventing her from leaving without his consent.</p>\n        <p>But Gladys still feels lucky. At least she has been allowed to keep her phone, she says, unlike some other foreign maids. Also, she is not physically abused. In Qatar, this happens all too often, she says.</p>\n        <p>There is another reason she wants to stay in her current job - she thinks it's unlikely at her age that she will get a better one. She earns 1,500 rials a month (just under £350) and is able to send it all home to support her family.</p>\n        <h3>Domestic workers' rights</h3>\n         <ul>\n        <li>There are an estimated 160,000 foreign domestic workers in Qatar, according to 2021 data from Qatar's Planning and Statistics Authority</li>\n        <li>In 2017 Qatar introduced the Domestic Workers Law, which limits working hours to 10 hours a day, and requires daily breaks, a weekly day off and paid holidays</li>\n        <li>In 2020 it also introduced a minimum wage and gave workers the right on paper to change jobs or leave the country without seeking permission</li>\n        <li>However, Amnesty International says these laws have not been properly implemented or enforced and extreme overwork, lack of rest, and abusive and degrading treatment continue</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Joanna Concepcion of Migrante International, a grassroots organisation supporting Filipino overseas workers, says that many keep quiet about bad working conditions because earning money for their families is their overriding priority.</p>\n        <p>But when those in Gulf states do feel confident enough to talk freely, she says, they often mention serious abuse. One woman said her employer would push her head into a toilet basin and deny her food and water when he was angry.</p>\n        <p><img src=\"maid_collage_illustration.jpg\" alt=\"maid collage illustration\"></p>\n        <p>By contrast, a maid employed by the ruling royal Al Thani family, says she is treated well - but she has no day off, as all workers now should under the new rules.</p>\n        <p>Smiley and animated, Althea (not her real name) video calls the BBC from the basement of a royal residence. She explains that her employers have given her an iPhone, clothes, jewellery and shoes of a kind she couldn't afford back home in the Philippines.</p>\n        <p>As in Gladys's case, it's the difficulty of earning a living wage at home that has brought her here.</p>\n        <p>As we speak, other Filipino domestic workers, who share a large room in Althea's living quarters, say Hi and join the call.</p>\n        <p>They have their own bedrooms and a shared kitchen. This is important. The maids Althea sees on TikTok and Facebook begging for food, and pleading for someone to rescue them, are not as fortunate.</p>\n        <p>\"I see those videos online all the time, which is why I feel so lucky,\" she says. \"For me, every day feels like a fairy tale.\"</p>\n        <p>Nonetheless, it's hard work in these \"Cinderella palaces\" as she refers to them, with their high ceilings and chandeliers, antiques inlaid with gold, mother-of-pearl table tops, and freshly cut flowers.</p>\n        <p>The day generally begins at 6.30am, when staff prepare breakfast for the family. Althea eats once the family has finished. After clearing away, they clean the rooms and set places for lunch.</p>\n        <p>\"It is light work because there are many of us,\" Althea says.</p>\n        <p>Maids rest in their flats between 3pm and 6pm, then prepare for dinner. Once dinner is over, Althea has finished work, and is free to leave the compound if she wants.</p>\n        <p>The royal family doesn't hold on to her passport. But Althea does work every day, including weekends. She doesn't get the day off that Qatari law is now supposed to guarantee. It's a price she pays for providing her family with vital financial support.</p>\n        <p>Mary Grace Morales, a recruiter in Manila who pairs Filipino staff with VIPs in the Gulf, says working for the palace is an \"enviable\" job.</p>\n        <p>\"The family is generous,\" she says. And, in a comment reflecting the hardships the maids may have faced at home, she adds: \"The girls get fatter while they are in the palace. The family feeds them well.\"</p>\n        <p>But the royals have some very specific requirements, she reveals.</p>\n        <p>\"The girls sent to work for the Qatari royal family are between 24 and 35 and very pretty,\" Ms Morales says.</p>\n        <p>She pauses to look at the screen where I stare back at her from the BBC headquarters in London.</p>\n        <p>\"Prettier than you,\" she says, smiling.</p>\n        <p>She later sends a WhatsApp to apologise, as her children overheard and said she had been rude. I assure her I was not offended - and don't mention that hiring people on the basis of their looks would be illegal in many countries.</p>\n        <p>'I am very afraid' says Qatari transgender woman</p>\n        <p>Joanna Concepcion, of Migrante International, says she hopes Althea's account of working as a royal maid is true, but adds: \"It's unlikely that we can know that for certain while she is still in Qatar and working for such a powerful family.\"</p>\n        <p>Some royal staff have complained after leaving the country. In 2019 three British and American workers - a bodyguard, personal trainer and private tutor - sued the emir's sister, Sheikha al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and her husband, in New York, alleging that they had been made to work long hours without overtime. The couple denied the allegations and settled without any admission of liability.</p>\n        <p>\"Reporting and addressing cases of violence and harassment, lack of occupational safety and health, and lack of decent accommodation can be challenging,\" says International Labour Organization (ILO) regional director for Arab states, Ruba Jaradat.</p>\n        <p>The ILO says it is working with Qatar to implement the new rules guaranteeing a minimum wage, a day off each week, sick leave and overtime payments, although this remains \"a challenge\".</p>\n        <p>Althea, in her royal palace, says she is happy despite the long hours.</p>\n        <p>When she goes to bed she will message one of her siblings or parents in the Philippines. She often feels homesick - a fairytale palace is not home.</p>\n        <p>However, it remains a crucial source of income.</p>\n        <p>\"I could never support my family without this job,\" she says.</p>\n        <p>The BBC asked the Qatari royal family and the Qatari embassy in London to comment, but received no reply.</p>\n        "

      "content": "\n         <p><b>\n         Digital travel scams are a growing \"systemic and global\" problem, according to the World Tourism Organization, a branch of the UN. Dozens of Brazilian women have been finding this out the hard way, after paying for luxury holidays from a man whose Instagram account sparkles with opulent hotels and exotic locations.\n         </b></p>\n         <p>Last December Maria (not her real name) decided to have a break from the heat of the Australian summer, and to take her family on a skiing holiday to Europe.</p>\n        <p>It was her first trip since the pandemic and she wanted it to be special. So she paid $20,000 to a travel agent, Rafael Bessa, a fellow Brazilian who had been recommended by a friend, and made the long flight north.</p>\n        <p>To begin with, everything was perfect, but as Maria checked out of the third hotel the manager told her the room had not been paid for.</p>\n        <p>Two further shocks came in quick succession. When Maria contacted Rafael Bessa to ask for help, she noticed he was unable to talk to the hotel manager in French, despite his claim to have attended an exclusive boarding school in the Alps. Then, when the family boarded a train to their next destination, there was a problem with the tickets: he had provided two tickets with the same purchase number, meaning that only one was valid.</p>\n        <p>At the next hotel it was a similar story: Maria had to settle the bill, even though she had paid in full already.</p>\n        <p>Initially she had assumed Rafael Bessa was simply incompetent. \"Then I said, 'No, this is not a mistake, this is on purpose. This is in bad faith.'\"</p>\n        <p>Altogether, Maria says she lost $30,000 on the holiday - $15,000 of the money she had paid in advance, plus an extra $15,000 for just one of the hotels. Maria says that as well as telling her he'd paid for the room, Rafael Bessa said he'd got her a free upgrade - but he hadn't, and the hotel charged the staggering full price for the super de luxe room.</p>\n        <p>Rafael Bessa's promises of reimbursement came to nothing, Maria says. Although he sent her various \"proofs\" of money transfers, the cash never actually arrived in her account.</p>\n        <p>Then, when she posted about her experiences on social media, she says his lawyer got in touch, offering to reimburse $20,000 as long as she signed a non-disclosure agreement. She refused.</p>\n        <p>The BBC asked Rafael Bessa to comment on Maria's allegations. He replied that there had been an unspecified \"problem\" with the price of one of the hotels, and that the room at this price had not been included in the package. He also sent copies of the train bookings - which, as Maria said, both bore the same purchase number.</p>\n        <p>Another Brazilian woman, Ana Jalenna, booked an Alpine skiing trip and also an Italian summer holiday with Rafael Bessa, after he had organised a \"fantastic\" family holiday for her in Brazil.</p>\n        <p>She paid part of the bill in cash, and the plan was that he would put the rest on her credit card. Some time later, she was surprised to see a payment to British Airways appear on her card account and called him to ask about it.</p>\n        <p>It was the payment for her Italian hotel, he told her. Finding this hard to believe, she emailed the hotel and was told no payment had been made.</p>\n        <p>Ana decided to ask Rafael Bessa for proof that he had at least made the bookings at the ski resort. He gave her two reservation numbers, but the hotel told her they were invalid.</p>\n        <p>\"I lost the money, the dream, the trip. I lost everything,\" she says.</p>\n        <p>She later spoke to other dissatisfied clients of Rafael Bessa's, and noticed a pattern.</p>\n        <p>\"The first trip was fantastic and everything is OK,\" she says. \"And then he does a longer trip, a better trip with expensive hotels, and he does this to people.\"</p>\n        <p>Rafael Bessa insisted to the BBC that he booked the Italian hotel. He said Ana cancelled the skiing trip, and he paid her back the money.</p>\n        <p>But Ana said she didn't cancel it - and wasn't reimbursed.</p>\n        <p>For Adriane Trofin, a Brazilian working mother of two who lives in London, the failure of her dream family holiday to Greece this year was more traumatic.</p>\n        <p>She first came across Rafael Bessa on Facebook, captivated by his posts from beautiful locations, and struck up an online friendship.</p>\n        <p>She explained that she couldn't afford that kind of holiday herself, but he replied that there were trips for every budget, and she ended up booking a dream holiday to Greece for 14 people in total - members of her family and a number of friends.</p>\n        <p>They had paid Rafael Bessa in advance for the stay at a four-star Club Med resort, but the cars that should have met them at Athens airport didn't arrive.</p>    \n        <p>Adriane messaged Rafael Bessa for help. He reassured her that everything had been booked, and gave her three telephone numbers for the car company, but she couldn't get through on any of them.</p>\n        <p>The group was stranded for hours. Eventually, the airport operations manager for Club Med, David Doepfer, came to their assistance. He quickly established that there was no Club Med booking in Adriane's name. Rafael Bessa had once reserved rooms, he learned, but had not paid for them before the expiry date.</p>\n        <p>David called the travel agent and asked him to book a different hotel in Athens for the group, which he agreed to do. But David says that when he called the new hotel to check Rafael Bessa had stuck to his word he was told the rooms had not been paid for.</p>\n        <p>In the end Adriane's husband paid for the entire group to stay in another hotel, at a cost of $8,500.</p>\n        <p>\"I spent that week, those seven days, discussing with Rafael day and night on the phone, trying to make him send at least a part of the money. He started to mock me,\" Adriane says. He also harassed other members of the group, she says, convincing some of them that the problem was Adriane's fault and that she owed him money.</p>\n        <p>\"I was in hell. I had never faced a worse situation in my life, I never had anything worse in my life than those seven days in Greece.</p>\n        <p>\"My marriage is still badly shaken by that. For me, it's a lot of money, you see? But it's no longer just about the money.\"</p>\n        <p>She says the experience left her \"emotionally destroyed\".</p>\n        <p>Despite having assured Adriane, as she waited at the airport, that everything would be fine, Rafael Bessa told the BBC he had cancelled the hotel booking because Adriane had failed to pay everything she owed him.</p>\n        <p>But Adriane showed the BBC evidence of money transfers made before the trip covering the full cost of the hotel. She had agreed with Rafael Bessa to pay for three plane tickets in instalments, and was up to date with these payments - which Mr Bessa confirmed in screengrabs of messages he sent to the BBC.</p>\n        <p>The BBC has spoken to 10 other clients of Rafael Bessa. Together with Maria, Ana and Adriane they say they paid him $90,000 for services that were not provided.</p>\n        <p>We also spoke to Brazilian lawyer Victor Penido Machado, who is bringing a case against Rafael Bessa on behalf of nearly 50 clients. They paid a total of $183,000 for hotel bookings and other services that were not delivered, he says.</p>\n        <p>A similar pattern is repeated again and again, the lawyer says. Clients arrive at their destinations, find a hotel has not been paid for, and are unable to get Rafael Bessa to pay them back.</p>\n        <p>Approached by the BBC, Mr Bessa denied the allegations made by his former clients, saying he was \"shocked\".</p>\n        <p>\"I'm really surprised by the amount of errors, 90% of your facts are false,\" he wrote.</p>\n        <p>The UN's World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) says social media is increasingly being used by travel agents to persuade customers to buy a dream holiday - one that they too can look forward to posting on social media.</p>\n        <p>\"Because they are being displayed on social media, tourists may have the perception that these services are more reliable than if they would find them on any regular website,\" says UNWTO legal counsel, Alicia Gomez.</p>\n        <p>At the same time, digital travel scams are on the rise all over the world, Ms Gomez says.</p>\n        <p>\"This has become a global and systemic problem. Many national consumers and authorities are reporting an increase in online scams, and the number may be even higher as the shame and the guilt of tourists that fall for them discourage reporting.\"</p>\n        <p>The UNWTO has developed a code for the protection of tourists, which it says clarifies the responsibilities of social media companies, governments and consumers and describes how governments and private companies can best work together.</p>\n        <p>Seven countries have signed up to the code so far, making it part of their national legislation, while others, including Brazil, are in the process of doing so.</p>\n        <p>Meta, owner of Instagram and Facebook, told the BBC: \"We don't allow fraudulent activity on our platforms and work closely with law enforcement to support investigations and keep scammers out.</p>\n        <p>\"We continue to invest in new technologies and spent approximately $5bn last year alone on safety and security.\"</p>\n        "

      "content": "\n         <p><b>\n         Imagine if your face had been digitally edited into a porn video without your consent and then shared on the internet. One woman reveals the horror of it happening to her.\n         </b></p>\n         \n         <p>Scrolling through her Twitter feed one evening, Kate Isaacs stumbled across a disturbing video among her notifications.</p>\n\n         <p>\"This panic just washed over me,\" Kate says, speaking publicly for the first time about what happened. \"Someone had taken my face, put it on to a porn video, and made it look like it was me.\"</p>\n         \n         <p>Kate had been deepfaked. Someone had used artificial intelligence to digitally manipulate her face onto someone else's - in this case a porn actress.</p>\n         \n         <p>The deepfake video on Twitter - with Kate, who campaigns against non-consensual porn, tagged - had been made using footage from TV interviews she had given while campaigning. It appeared to show her having sex.</p>\n         \n         <p>\"My heart sank. I couldn't think clearly,\" she says. \"I remember just feeling like this video was going to go everywhere - it was horrendous.\"</p>\n         \n         <p>Kate was tagged in a tweet with a link to the deepfake</p>\n         \n         <p>In the past, high-profile celebrities and politicians were the most common targets of deepfakes - the videos weren't always porn, some were made for comedic value. But over the years that's changed - according to cybersecurity company Deeptrace, 96% of all deepfakes are non-consensual porn.</p>\n         \n         <p>Like revenge porn, deepfake pornography is what's known as image-based sexual abuse - an umbrella term which encompasses the taking, making and/or sharing of intimate images without consent.</p>\n         \n         <p>It is already an offence in Scotland to share images or videos that show another person in an intimate situation without their consent. But in other parts of the UK, it's only an offence if it can be proved that such actions were intended to cause the victim distress - a loophole which means video creators often don't face legal consequences.</p>\n         \n         <p>Government plans for a long-awaited UK-wide Online Safety Bill have been under endless revision and repeatedly shelved. The new laws would give the regulator, Ofcom, the power to take action against any website deemed to be enabling harm to UK users, no matter where they are based in the world. Earlier this month, however, Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan said she and her team were now \"working flat out\" to ensure the bill was delivered.</p>\n         \n         <p>Kate, 30, founded the #NotYourPorn campaign in 2019. A year later, her activism contributed to the adult entertainment website, Pornhub, having to take down all videos uploaded to the site by unverified users - the majority of its content.</p>\n         \n         <p>Kate therefore assumed that whoever was behind the deepfake of her had been annoyed by her campaigning. She had \"taken away their porn\".</p>\n         \n         <p>But she had no idea who that person was, or who might have seen the video. And while she could see that her face had been overlaid onto footage of a porn actor, the video was convincing enough that she worried others might not spot the deception.</p>\n         \n         <p>\"It was a violation - my identity was used in a way I didn't consent to.\"</p>\n         \n         <p>Underneath the video, people began leaving streams of abusive comments, saying they were going to follow Kate home, rape her, film the attack, and publish the footage on the internet.</p>\n         \n         <p>\"You start thinking about your family,\" she says, holding back tears. \"How would they feel if they saw this content?\"</p>\n         \n         <p>The threat intensified when both Kate's home and work addresses were published below the video - a practice known as doxing.</p>\n         \n         <p>\"I became completely paranoid - 'Who knows my address? Is it someone I know that's done this?'</p>\n         <p>\"I was thinking, 'I'm really in trouble here, this isn't just some people on the internet mouthing off, there's actually a real danger.'\"</p>\n        <p>From her experience supporting others in similar situations, Kate knew exactly what to do if someone becomes a victim - but in that moment she froze.</p>\n        <p>\"I didn't follow any of my own advice,\" she says. \"Kate the campaigner was very strong and didn't show any vulnerability - and then there was me, Kate, who was really scared.\"</p>\n        <p>A colleague reported the video, vicious comments and doxing to Twitter, and they were all taken down from the platform. But once any deepfake has been published and shared online it's difficult to remove it from circulation entirely.</p>\n        <p>\"I just wanted that video off the internet,\" Kate says, \"but there was nothing I could do about it.\"</p>\n        <p>There's a marketplace for deepfakes in online forums. People post requests for videos to be made of their wives, neighbours and co-workers and - unfathomable as it might seem - even their mothers, daughters and cousins.</p>\n        <p>Content creators respond with step-by-step instructions - what source material they'll need, advice on which filming angles work best, and price tags for the work.</p>\n        <p>A deepfake content creator based in south-east England, Gorkem, spoke to the BBC anonymously. He began creating celebrity deepfakes for his own gratification - he says they allow people to \"realise their fantasies in ways that really wasn't [sic] possible before\".</p>\n        <p>Later, Gorkem moved on to deepfaking women he was attracted to, including colleagues at his day job who he barely knew.</p>\n        <p>\"One was married, the other in a relationship,\" he says. \"Walking into work after having deepfaked these women - it did feel odd, but I just controlled my nerves. I can act like nothing's wrong - no-one would suspect.\"</p>\n        <p>Realising he could make money from what he refers to as his \"hobby\", Gorkem started taking commissions for custom deepfakes. Gathering footage from women's social media profiles provides him with plenty of source material. He says he even recently deepfaked a woman using a Zoom call recording.</p>\n        <p>\"With a good amount of video, looking straight at the camera, that's good data for me. Then the algorithm can just extrapolate from that and make a good reconstruction of the face on the destination video.\"</p>\n        <p>He accepts \"some women\" could be psychologically harmed by being deepfaked, but seems indifferent about the potential impact of the way he is objectifying them.</p>\n        <p>\"They can just say, 'It's not me - this has been faked.' They should just recognise that and get on with their day.</p>\n        <p>\"From a moral standpoint I don't think there's anything that would stop me,\" he says. \"If I'm going to make money from a commission I would do it, it's a no brainer.\"</p>\n        <p>The standard of deepfakes can vary wildly, and depends both on the expertise of the person who made the video and the sophistication of the technology used.</p>\n        <p>But the man behind the largest deepfake porn website admits it's no longer easy to know for certain whether you're looking at manipulated images or not. His site attracts about 13 million visitors a month and hosts roughly 20,000 videos at any one time. He is based in the US and rarely speaks to the media - but he agreed to talk to the BBC anonymously.</p>\n        <p>Deepfaking \"ordinary\" women is a red line for him, he says, but in his view, hosting pornographic deepfake videos of celebrities, social media influencers and politicians, is justifiable.</p>\n        <p>\"They're accustomed to negative media, their content is available in the mainstream. They're different to normal citizens,\" he says.</p>\n        <p>\"The way I see it, they are able to deal with it in a different way - they can just brush it off. I don't really feel consent is required - it's a fantasy, it's not real.\"</p>\n        <p>Does he think what he's doing is wrong? Part of him is \"in denial about the impact on women\", he admits - and notably, he reveals that his spouse doesn't know what he does for a living.</p>\n        <p>\"I haven't told my wife. I'm afraid of how it might affect her.\"</p>\n        <p>Until relatively recently, deepfake software wasn't easily available, and the average person wouldn't have had the skills to make them. But now, anyone over the age of 12 can legally download dozens of apps and make convincing deepfakes in a few clicks.</p>\n        <p>For Kate that's worrying and \"really scary\".</p>\n        <p>\"It's not the dark web, it's in the app stores - right in front of our faces.\"</p>\n        <p>\"I'm not letting them win,\" says Kate</p>\n        <p>She also fears the hoped-for Online Safety Bill won't keep up with technology. Three years ago, when the bill was first drafted, deepfake creation was seen as a professional skill in which someone would need to be trained - not merely download an app.</p>\n        <p>\"We're years down the line and the contents of [the bill] are out of date - there's so much missing,\" she says.</p>\n        <p>But for creator Gorkem, criminalising deepfaking would change things.</p>\n        <p>\"If I could be traced online I would stop there and probably find another hobby,\" he says.</p>\n        <p>Being deepfaked and doxed had an impact on Kate's health and her ability to trust other people. She believes those behind the attacks weren't only trying to intimidate and humiliate her, but also to silence her. For a time, she stepped back from campaigning, questioning whether she could carry on speaking out about misogyny.</p>\n        <p>But now, she is all the more fired-up. She realised she cared too much to walk away.</p>\n        <p>\"I'm not letting them win.\"</p>\n        <p>Deepfakes can be used to control women, and tech firms - including those who make apps that enable face-swapping - should be encouraged to put safeguards in place, she says.</p>\n        <p>\"Any app should be able to detect sexual content.\"</p>\n        <p>\"If companies have not put money, resources and time into ensuring their app isn't being used as a place to create sexual abuse content, they are being deliberately irresponsible. They are culpable.\"</p>\n        <p>Neither Gorkem, nor the man behind the largest deepfake website, are understood to have been involved in deepfaking Kate Isaacs</p>\n        "

They say people from the UK are the most generous gifters.</p>\n        <p>Mona Ali Al-Karim and her six daughters are among the families who go live on TikTok every day, sitting on the floor of their tent for hours, repeating the few English phrases they know: \"Please like, please share, please gift.\"</p>\n        <p>Mona's husband was killed in an airstrike and she is using the livestreams to raise money for an operation for her daughter Sharifa, who is blind.</p>\n        <p>The gifts they're asking for are virtual, but they cost the viewers real money and can be withdrawn from the app as cash. Livestream viewers send the gifts - ranging from digital roses, costing a few cents, to virtual lions costing around $500 - to reward or tip creators for content.</p>\n        <p>For five months, the BBC followed 30 TikTok accounts broadcasting live from Syrian camps for displaced people and built a computer program to scrape information from them, showing that viewers were often donating digital gifts worth up to $1,000 an hour to each account.</p>\n        <p>Families in the camps said they were receiving only a tiny fraction of these sums, however.</p>\n        <p>With TikTok declining to say how much it takes from gifts, the BBC ran an experiment to track where the money goes.</p>\n        <p>A reporter in Syria contacted one of the TikTok-affiliated agencies saying he was living in the camps. He obtained an account and went live, while BBC staff in London sent TikTok gifts worth $106 from another account.</p>\n        <p>At the end of the livestream, the balance of the Syrian test account was $33. TikTok had taken 69% of the value of the gifts.</p>\n        <p>TikTok influencers and other users are livestreaming for hours, urging viewers to give digital gifts with cash value, according to a recent report by the BBC. Despite some streams earning up to £900 per hour, those in the Syrian camps reportedly received only a small percentage of this amount. TikTok said it did not allow such content and would take prompt action against \"exploitative begging\", adding that its commission from digital gifts was considerably less than 70%, though the company did not confirm the exact figure. Middlemen, who provide phones and equipment to go live and said they were supported by live agencies affiliated to TikTok in China and the Middle East, facilitated the trend. </p>\n        <p>Former professional rugby player and TikTok influencer Keith Mason donated £300 during one livestream and urged his one million followers to do the same. However, when he was informed that most of the funds went to the social media firm, he described this as \"ridiculous\" and \"unfair\" to Syrian families. It has been claimed that TikTok middlemen take 35% of the remaining donations, with some families receiving as little as $19. Meanwhile, one of the middlemen, called Hamid, broadcasts with 12 different families, several hours a day, claiming to pay most of the profits to the families, minus his running costs. </p>\n        <p>TikTok influencer and ex-professional rugby player Keith Mason donated £300 ($330) during one family's livestream and encouraged his nearly one million followers to do the same.</p>\n        <p>When told by the BBC that most of these funds were taken by the social media company, he said it was \"ridiculous\" and \"unfair\" to families in Syria.</p>\n        <p>\"You've got to have some transparency. To me, that's very greedy. It's greed,\" he said.</p>\n        <p>The $33 remaining from the BBC's $106 gift was reduced by a further 10% when it was withdrawn from the local money transfer shop. TikTok middlemen would take 35% of the remainder, leaving a family with just $19.</p>\n        <p>Hamid, one of the TikTok middlemen in the camps, told the BBC he had sold his livestock to pay for a mobile phone, SIM card and wi-fi connection to work with families on TikTok.</p>\n        <p>He now broadcasts with 12 different families, for several hours a day.</p>\n        <p>Hamid said he uses TikTok to help families make a living. He pays them most of the profits, minus his running costs, he said.</p>\n        <p>Like the other middlemen, Hamid said he was supported by \"live agencies\" in China, who work directly with TikTok.</p>\n        <p>\"They help us if we have any problems with the app. They unlock blocked accounts. We give them the name of the page, the profile picture, and they open the account,\" Hamid said.</p>\n        <p>Agencies like these, known as \"livestreaming guilds\" and based all around the world, are contracted by TikTok to help content creators produce more appealing livestreams.</p>\n        <p>TikTok pays them a commission according to the duration of livestreams and the value of gifts received, the agencies told the BBC.</p>\n        <p>The emphasis on duration means TikTokers, including children in the Syrian camps, go live for hours at a time.</p>\n        <p>Marwa Fatafta, from digital rights organisation Access Now, says these livestreams run contrary to TikTok's own policies to \"prevent the harm, endangerment or exploitation\" of minors on the platform.</p>\n        <p>\"TikTok clearly states that users are not allowed to explicitly solicit gifts, so this is a clear violation of their own terms of services, as well as the rights of these people,\" she said.</p>\n        <p>She acknowledges that people have the right to share their stories online \"to try to seek support and sympathy\", but she says these livestreams \"lack dignity, and are humiliating\".</p>\n        <p>TikTok's rules say you must have 1,000 followers before you can go live, you must not directly solicit for gifts and must \"prevent the harm, endangerment or exploitation\" of minors on the platform.</p>\n        <p>But when the BBC used the in-app system to report 30 accounts featuring children begging, TikTok said there had been no violation of its policies in any of the cases.</p>\n        <p>After the BBC contacted TikTok directly for comment, the company banned all of the accounts.</p>\n        <p>It said in a statement: \"We are deeply concerned by the information and allegations brought to us by the BBC, and have taken prompt and rigorous action.</p>\n        <p>\"This type of content is not allowed on our platform, and we are further strengthening our global policies around exploitative begging.\"</p>\n        <p>TikTok, the world's fastest-growing social media app, has made more than $6.2bn in gross revenue from in-app spending since its launch in 2017, according to analytics company Sensor Tower.</p>\n        <p>The BBC approached several charities working in Syria to support families in the camps as an alternative to making money on TikTok Live.</p>\n        <p>A local charity Takaful Alsham said it would provide basic supplies to the families for the next three months, helping the children find schools and covering their educational expenses.</p>\n        <p>But for many in the camps, there are few options to make money other than begging online. Hundreds of families continue to go live every day, and most of the money donated is still going to TikTok.</p>\n        "

      "content": "\n         <p><b>\n         Jade McCrossen-Nethercott's rape case was dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) because of claims she had an episode of a rare sleep condition called \"sexsomnia\". As a result, the CPS no longer believed they could secure a conviction. But Jade challenged the decision and spent months reinvestigating.\n         </b></p>\n         <p>The CPS now admit they were wrong not to take it to trial and have apologised unreservedly to her.</p>\n         <p>But what went wrong? The BBC followed Jade's case as events unfolded.</p>\n         <p>It was a Sunday evening in the spring of 2017 when Jade woke up on a sofa in south London to discover she was half-naked, with her necklace lying broken on the floor.</p>\n         <p>The 24-year-old, originally from St Ives in Cornwall, had the intense feeling she had been penetrated and thought she had been raped while she slept.</p>\n         <p>Three years later - and just days before the man charged with raping her was due to stand trial - lawyers from the CPS called her to an urgent meeting at a police station.</p>\n         <p>Her case was being dropped. The CPS lawyer explained that two sleep experts had given their opinions on her case. They said it was possible Jade had had an episode of sexsomnia and could have appeared to have been awake and consenting.</p>\n         <p>Sexsomnia is a medically-recognised sleep disorder. People with the condition perform sexual acts in their sleep.</p>\n         <p>A person is deemed not to have consented to sex if they are asleep, according to the law in England and Wales. However, it also states that a person is not guilty of rape if they had \"reasonable belief\" in consent.</p>\n         <p>\"It came completely out of the blue, and it was baffling,\" says Jade, who had never heard of sexsomnia until then.</p>\n         <p>\"I've had two long-term relationships spanning 13 years, and I've never had anything like this.\"</p>\n         <p>The decision by the CPS meant they would close the case and the defendant would be formally acquitted.</p>\n         <p>The first time Jade had been asked about her sleep, was in the police station when she went to give a formal statement.</p>\n         <p>In response to a question from a police officer, she explained that she had always been a deep sleeper and had sleepwalked a couple of times as a teenager.</p>\n         <p>It was a passing comment, forgotten about in the whole gruelling process until her case was dropped.</p>\n         <p>It had been Jade's best friend Bel who had dialled 999 and started the whole police process.</p>\n        <p>She remembers the sound of Jade's voice on the other end of the line. \"It was like nothing I've ever heard before. She was hysterical and sobbing, and she said 'I think I've been raped.' When your best friend says that to you, it's just earth-shattering.\"</p>\n        <p>The two had been out the evening before at a bar in south London. They had got ready together, drinking prosecco as they did their makeup and headed out arm-in-arm.</p>\n        <p>It was a fun evening, drinking and chatting. When closing time came, Bel ordered a taxi home. Jade decided to go back to a friend's flat with a few people for a last drink.</p>\n        <p>At around 02:00, with people still chatting around her in the living room, she curled up under a blanket in the corner of the sofa, fully-clothed, and fell asleep.</p>\n        <p>At 05:00 she says she woke up to find her trousers and pants were off and her bra was undone. She says she saw a man on the other side of the sofa she was lying on.</p>\n        <p>\"I confronted him saying, 'What's happened? What have you done?' And he said something a bit odd I guess, but he did say 'I thought you were awake.'</p>\n        <p>\"And he just bolted out basically, and left the door open. And I got my phone and started calling Bel…\"</p>\n        <p>Two male police officers arrived and took Jade straight for forensic tests. Vaginal swabs detected semen which would later be matched to the man on the sofa.</p>\n        <p>The suspect offered no comment when initially questioned by police. The CPS made the decision to charge him with rape. He pleaded not guilty. A date was set for trial.</p>\n        <p>But it never went ahead.</p>\n        <p>Jade was determined to prove the CPS were wrong to drop her case, but she had limited time to appeal.</p>\n        <p>She requested all the evidence - including police interviews, toxicology results, witness statements and the sleep experts' reports - and pored over them.</p>\n        <p>She was shocked by what she read - and in particular the weight given to the sleep experts' theories.</p>\n        <p>When unexpected sleepwalking claims turn a rape case on its head, Jade fights back. Filmed over three years, this is the remarkable story of one woman's battle for justice. Will she win?</p>\n        <p>Neither expert had met her in person, but their opinions had been significant enough to close her case.</p>\n        <p>The first expert, who had been instructed by the defence, concluded there was a \"strong possibility\" that Jade had an attack of sexsomnia, saying \"her behaviour would have been of someone actively engaging in sexual activity with eyes open and showing pleasure\".</p>\n        <p>The CPS then hired their own expert in response. He concluded that \"a history of sleepwalking, even once at the age of 16 years, and ongoing sleep talking or any family history, is entirely adequate to establish a predisposition to sexsomnia\".</p>\n        <p>Jade was speechless. \"I don't see how this can be one isolated incident [of sexsomnia], that just so happens to be the time that somebody I would never have consented to have sex with had sex with me,\" she says.</p>\n        <p>Jade decided to pay for her own expert opinion and approached Dr Irshaad Ebrahim at the London Sleep Centre. He also has experience of giving expert opinions in rape cases.</p>\n        <p>Jade's case was the first he had seen where a complainant victim was purported to have sexsomnia. In all the other rape cases he had encountered, it was the defendant claiming to have had an attack of sexsomnia. The BBC carried out extensive research and could not find any other UK rape case where the defence had argued the complainant had sexsomnia.</p>\n        <p>Dr Ebrahim explained there was limited scientific research and no precise way of diagnosing sexsomnia. But he said people he sees with the disorder are typically male and tend to have a history of the sexual behaviour in their sleep.</p>\n        <p>Jade then underwent a sleep test - a polysomnography, which monitors brainwaves, breathing and movement during sleep.</p>\n        <p>The test indicated that she snores and has mild sleep apnea, a common condition where breathing stops and starts during sleep. Both were, according to Dr Ebrahim, potential trigger factors for sexsomnia, so he could not rule out that she may have had an isolated episode.</p>\n        <p>Jade wanted to know if he could give her a clear idea of what the chances were that sexsomnia had been to blame for what happened.</p>\n        <p>\"That is the billion dollar question,\" said Dr Ebrahim.</p>\n        <p>\"Wanting a definitive, black and white answer - yes it was or no it wasn't - is not going to happen.\"</p>\n        <p>Jade still believed she didn't have sexsomnia - but was frustrated the sleep experts couldn't rule it out.</p>\n        <p>She turned to a lawyer to find out more about how courts treat the disorder as a defence.</p>\n        <p>Barrister Allison Summers KC has defended in rape cases where the man accused has claimed to have sexsomnia.</p>\n        <p>She told Jade that sleep experts are almost never able to say definitively whether someone has the condition - but saying \"it's possible\" could be enough for a jury to reach a not guilty verdict.</p>\n        <p>\"Do I think, as a result of that, that some guilty people get off or are acquitted? Yes, I do. But I generally come back to the point that I would rather that be the case, than we're convicting people of serious offences that are genuinely not guilty,\" she said.</p>\n        <p>\"The only thing I can say is that you hope the criminal trial process will enable those genuine cases to be pulled out from those less genuine.\"</p>\n        <p>Sexsomnia and other sleepwalking defences should always be robustly challenged in court, according to the CPS guidelines.</p>\n        <p>But Jade's case never made it to court. Armed with her research, she submitted her appeal, known as a victim's right to review.</p>\n        <p>A chief crown prosecutor, independent of the CPS department which made the original decision to close the case, reviewed all the evidence again.</p>\n        <p>He concluded the case should have gone to trial - and that the sleep experts' opinions, and the defendant's account, should have been challenged in court.</p>\n        <p>A jury would have been \"more likely than not\" to convict the defendant, he said - one of the tests a case must meet for the CPS to take it to trial.</p>\n        <p>\"I cannot begin to imagine what you have been through and how you feel. I noted during my review the devastating effect of this case on you,\" he wrote to Jade.</p>\n        <p>\"I apologise unreservedly for this on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service although I appreciate that is likely to be of little consolation to you.\"</p>\n        <p>For Jade, the acknowledgement that her case should have been put to a jury was bittersweet - because the CPS cannot reopen the case.</p>\n        <p>The defendant was found officially not guilty - and so double jeopardy laws mean he cannot be tried without compelling new evidence.</p>\n        <p>\"There is no hope of any justice for what happened to me,\" says Jade - but she hopes the CPS will learn lessons to prevent others from going through similar ordeals.</p>\n        <p>\"It's just being let down by a system that's there to protect - and they've openly said they messed up,\" she says.</p>\n        <p>In the year to September 2021, just 1.3% of rape cases recorded by police in England and Wales resulted in a suspect being prosecuted, according to Home Office figures.</p>\n        <p>The CPS say they are \"committed to improving every aspect of how life-changing crimes like rape are dealt with and are working closely with the police to transform how they are handled.\"</p>\n        <p>Jade is now suing the CPS for damages.</p>\n        "

She eventually escaped by rolling her wheelchair into the road.</p>\n         <p>On another occasion, Cassie was pushed out of her wheelchair by a woman who wanted to use the wheelchair space on a London bus for her pushchair.</p>\n        <p>\"It was very humiliating,\" Cassie says. The bus driver witnessed the incident, helped Cassie and refused to let the other woman travel.</p>\n        <p>Cassie says the incidents she has endured - including being shouted at on the street and accused of faking her disability - have all been \"intrinsically tied\" to her disability.</p>\n        <p>But, she admits, she hasn't always reported her experiences immediately because she wasn't sure they would be considered hate crimes.</p>\n        <p>Ali Gunn, policy lead for United Response, which was involved in the research, says Cassie's experience is common.</p>\n        <p>\"A lot of the time victims don't even know they've been a victim of a disability hate crime\" and, as a result, the number of reported incidents could be the \"tip of the iceberg\".</p>\n        <p>She says a disability hate crime is classed as \"any criminal offence that is motivated by a person's disability or perceived disability\".</p>\n        <p>Of those hate crimes that were reported but went no further, Ali says: \"We found that around 50% of the no-charge outcomes were a result of either the victim withdrawing support, evidential difficulties despite there being a named suspect, or that the police were unable to find a suspect.\"</p>\n        <p>She says its \"really important for the victim to capture as much information as possible - what they hear, what they see, or what's happening and the date, the time, the location\".</p>\n        <p>But she adds that the whole community should play its part.</p>\n        <p>\"If you witness a crime you might feel uncomfortable or nervous to go up at the time, but afterwards please support the victim. Give your phone number, give any information that you were able to record at that point in time about what happened.\"</p>\n        <p>The two charities - Leonard Cheshire and United Response - which conducted the research have called for police forces to appoint Disability Liaison Officers.</p>\n        <p>\"They would be able to support a disabled victim from the point of reporting all the way through,\" Ali says, hopefully resulting in a higher charge rate.</p>\n        <p>This week, the Home Office also released its statistics on hate crimes. It reported that 14,242 disability hate crimes had been recorded in the year ending March 2022 - an increase of 43% on the previous year.</p>\n        <p>That figure has doubled since 2017/2018 with stalking and harassment offences the most commonly recorded disability hate crimes.</p>\n        <p>A Home Office spokesperson described hate crime as a \"scourge on communities\" and said that \"while the rise is likely to be largely driven by improvements in police recording, we cannot be complacent.\"</p>\n        <p>They added: \"[We] expect the police to fully investigate these hateful attacks and make sure the cowards who commit them feel the full force of the law.\"</p>\n        <p>After thinking about the incident with the men, Cassie did report it to the police. She received a call from an officer and a case number, but says she never heard from them again, putting Cassie's case in the 99% that result in no charge. The force was unable to corroborate this information.</p>\n        <p>Cassie is getting on with her PhD, but says the \"terrifying\" experiences have stayed with her and she has changed where she shops and which public transport she uses as a result.</p>\n        <p>\"Even now, I get this anxiety - what if something happens?\" she says.</p>\n        "

At the age of eight, he seized his chance.\n         </b></p>\n         \n         <p>When a beautiful car pulled up one day outside St Vincent's orphanage in South Korea, Milton Washington made a split-second decision that would change the course of his life.</p>\n         <p>A black American couple stepped out. The man was in military uniform, the woman had an Afro and wore a beautiful flowing dress, and when Milton realised that they were going to adopt his friend Joseph - who was black and Korean just like him - he ran to the couple's car, jumped inside and locked all the doors.</p>\n         <p>Crying and screaming for his life, he wasn't getting out unless the man and woman took him home with them too.</p>\n         <p>The couple - Captain and Mrs Washington - agreed to take both Joseph and Milton home, but only to see which of them fitted in best with their family. They would give it a few days, they said, and then make their choice.</p>\n         <p>That night, lying in bed in an unfamiliar bedroom, in an unfamiliar house at the Dongducheon American military base, little Milton made his second big decision of the day - and ran away.</p>\n         <p>\"I didn't want to get taken back to the orphanage - maybe they wouldn't choose me,\" he says.</p>\n         <p>\"I was just trying to get to America.\"</p>\n         <p>Milton knew that his father was from the US - in his mind a land of flying cars, where the cities were made of gold, with ice-cream mountains.</p>\n        <p>\"I dreamed of going to America because it was full of black people - these magical creatures,\" Milton says, \"and of being accepted.\"</p>\n        <p>Milton's America was a fantasy land that couldn't have been more different from his reality. He and his mother lived in a mud and stone hut, slept on the floor, and washed their clothes in the river.</p>\n        <p>One morning, village elders arrived at the door and told Milton's mother they would no longer accept \"the shame that you're bringing upon this village because of that boy\". Although Milton's mother argued their case, she and Milton left their home and moved to a nearby town attached to an American military base. There were cars there, electricity, and money, all of which were new to Milton - salt had been the currency in their village.</p>\n        <p>Milton also saw black American soldiers for the first time, and felt a step closer to finding his father.</p>\n        <p>In the alleys of the red-light district below their tiny apartment, homeless boys begged, picked pockets, and fought with other gangs. The American soldiers called them \"slickyboys\" - slang for little thieves. And when six-year-old Milton shared a packet of Oreos with the boys - given to him by his mum's American boyfriend - he became a slickyboy too. Milton finally felt like he belonged.</p>\n        <p>\"All the black soldiers would give me money - dollar bills, not just change,\" he says. \"It completely changed my life.\"</p>\n        <p>Milton's mother had become a sex worker in a club in town and went out at night to work. Milton was left alone in their apartment - under strict instruction not to leave, instructions he routinely ignored.</p>\n        <p>One night Milton's mum didn't return from work as expected - the club had been raided by the police and she and all the other women who worked there were sent to jail for two weeks.</p>\n        <p>Free of his mother's rules, Milton and his friends ran wild, stealing drinks from bars and having adventures all over town.</p>\n        <p>When his mum returned, she made sure Milton was never left alone again. Each time she got wind of a police raid, she would drop Milton at an orphanage for a couple of weeks so that he was safe.</p>\n        <p>Milton remembers being racially abused by the other, mostly Korean, kids at these orphanages, as he had been in the village growing up. But this time, he didn't let it get to him.</p>\n        <p>\"I would almost laugh it off,\" he says. \"'Yeah, I may be these racial slurs that you're talking about - but you're the orphan. I have a mother, she says she's going to be back in two weeks.' And she was always back in two weeks.\"</p>\n        <p>For a while, this routine continued. Then one morning, Milton and his mum took a taxi to a different orphanage, where many of the children looked like Milton. It was an orphanage for children born to American servicemen and Korean mothers, called the St Vincent's home for Amerasian children.</p>\n        <p>Milton's mum assured him she'd be back the following day and promised him a present - he asked for a train set. But when she returned there was no train set, just a hug that he didn't know meant goodbye.</p>\n        <p>\"She told me, 'I need you to be strong,'\" he says. \"That was the last time I saw her.\"</p>\n        <p>It wasn't long after Milton first arrived at St Vincent's orphanage that Captain and Mrs Washington took him to their home on a military base - from where he decided to run away.</p>\n        <p>He didn't get far. He was still small and the compound fences were high, and a search party found him, hours later, sound asleep in a children's playground.</p>\n        <p>But the incident shook the Washingtons, who decided that both Milton and Joseph could stay with them permanently. The boys were adopted in 1977 and eventually moved to America - becoming part of a noisy, loving family of six children, who rode bikes, played sports, and went to school - all the normal childhood things Milton had longed for.</p>\n        <p>But he worried about what had become of his mother and would cry himself to sleep. He was haunted by dreams of wading through paddy fields looking for her. She had always been his \"island of refuge in a very tough world\", he says.</p>\n        <p>Now in his 50s - he's not sure of his exact age - Milton works as a photographer in New York and is writing a memoir called \"Slickyboy\". He's always remained curious about his biological family, and in recent years began to look for connections via DNA websites. In April 2019, he got a hit. It was a family member on his mother's side, who wanted to speak to him immediately.</p>\n        <p>\"Hello, I'm calling from Seattle,\" the voice - with a strong Korean accent - said.</p>\n        <p>\"This is Milton-ah (little Milton),\" he said, using the name his birth mother had often called him.</p>\n        <p>\"I am your sister, Tong, do you remember me?\"</p>\n        <p>Milton did remember meeting Tong - she was one of his older sisters, and they had met a handful of times in Korea when Milton was a little boy. Tong had lived with their grandparents, from whom Milton's mother was estranged.</p>\n        <p>Speaking to his half-sister, Milton says, was \"an incredible moment\".</p>\n        <p>\"I was just really excited [to be] connected with my past, and to have my memories validated by her.\"</p>\n        <p>Milton had not expected his mother to survive, but Tong told him she'd lived a long life, and had died just a few years previously. His mother and sisters had come to the US in 1998, and though they knew that Milton was living there too, Milton's mum had felt she had no right to contact him.</p>\n        <p>But she had left a keepsake for Milton with Tong - a gold and jade necklace to remember her by.</p>\n        <p>Milton keeps searching for answers about his father. He believes his dad likely came from Louisiana, but has little more information.</p>\n        <p>\"I want to know what kind of man he is. He's the only missing link,\" Milton says.</p>\n        <p>Despite the sadness he still sometimes feels, Milton is certain his mum made the right decision giving him up all those years ago.</p>\n        <p>\"She knew that if I had a shot at an American life, I would do well at it. I love her for that act,\" he says.</p>\n        <p>\"There is a hole in my heart that's always going to be there. But the benefits of my current life versus what it could have been - there's no argument there.\"</p>\n        "

He was diagnosed with stage 3 bowel cancer, which was successfully treated with surgery.</p>\n        <p>The gold standard treatment is to then have intravenous chemotherapy to mop up any remaining tumour cells and reduce the risk of the cancer returning.</p>\n        <p>But the chemotherapy used in bowel cancer, oxaliplatin, can cause painful tingling and numbness in the hands and feet, called peripheral neuropathy.</p>\n        <p>This nerve damage can be long-term, and Ben was worried it might affect his ability to do the job he loves.</p>\n        <p>\"I would not be able to cope with that,\" he says. \"I need to work - it's my therapy.\"</p>\n        <p>The 52-year-old enrolled in a study at London's Royal Marsden Hospital, which is evaluating whether a blood test can show if chemo is really needed.</p>\n        <p>His test showed he was clear of cancer, so he avoided intravenous chemotherapy.</p>\n        <p>Instead, like everyone taking part in the trial, he took an oral chemo tablet twice a day. This had minimal side effects and allowed him to carry on working.</p>\n        <p>\"The fact that I didn't have any tingling in my hands has just been an absolute blessing,\" he says.</p>\n        <p>Ben's blood is extracted for the liquid biopsy</p>\n        <p>The blood tests work by looking for microscopic traces of cancer in the bloodstream called circulating tumour DNA. The presence of these markers indicates whether the patient has been cured by their surgery or not. Such tiny fragments would be invisible on a scan.</p>\n        <p>Ben's consultant at the Marsden, Dr Naureen Starling, is the principal investigator on the trial. She says the outcome could affect the way thousands of bowel cancer patients are treated every year.</p>\n        <p>\"Half of patients with stage 3 bowel cancer are cured by surgery alone, so we are over-treating a large proportion of patients,\" she says.</p>\n        <p>The hope is that this specialised technology could spare many cancer patients unnecessary chemotherapy.</p>\n        <p>\"That's good for the patient, it's good for the health service, it's good for cost savings within the NHS. That would be a win-win,\" says Dr Starling.</p>\n        <p>The liquid biopsies being packaged to send to California</p>\n        <p>The trial, called TRACC, is using a test created by US company Guardant Health. The samples are sent to their labs in California for analysis with the results coming back within around two weeks.</p>\n        <h3>Survival outcomes</h3>\n        <p>The trial, funded by the National Institute for Health &amp; Care Research (NIHR), will examine any difference in survival rates after three years between those patients whose treatment was guided by the blood test compared with the standard-of-care chemotherapy group.</p>\n        <p>Trials are also under way in the UK to monitor patients with lung and breast cancer in the same way.</p>\n        <p>Dr Starling says the potential for this new technology across cancer care is \"immense\", not just when it comes to detecting residual disease after surgery, but also for early diagnosis.</p>\n        <p>What is clear already, from multiple studies, is that so-called \"liquid biopsy\" blood tests can reveal the lingering presence of cancer long before it would be found using traditional methods.</p>\n        <p>A trial in Greece published in Nature in January, found that liquid biopsies could show cancer recurrence at least four years before it would be detectable via a scan. That study followed a small group of breast cancer patients after surgery.</p>\n        <p>At the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago last June, a study in 455 bowel cancer patients found that by using the blood tests to guide treatment, the number of patients needing post-surgery chemotherapy was nearly halved without the risk of relapse.</p>\n        <p>But Dr Starling says the far bigger randomised trial in the UK is essential to calibrate exactly how much reliance can be placed on liquid biopsies, especially when it means considering the withdrawal of chemotherapy.</p>\n        <p>The tests have already been available to private patients.</p>\n        <p>Susanne Winter, an artist from Surrey, was diagnosed with stage 3 bowel cancer in March 2022 and had successful surgery to remove the tumour and some cancerous lymph nodes.</p>\n        <p>She initially thought she would need chemotherapy to ensure the cancer was entirely gone, but she had the ctDNA test done privately which showed she was clear of cancer.</p>\n        <p>Susanne, 58, had cancelled all her commitments to prepare for several months of chemotherapy, but the negative test result meant she was free to concentrate on her art. She even had two works accepted for the Royal Academy summer exhibition.</p>\n        <p>She feels incredibly lucky to have avoided chemotherapy. \"I knew how toxic it can be. You're psyching yourself up for it, so to hear that you aren't going to need it is just unbelievable,\" she says.</p>\n        <p>What is considered the holy grail of cancer detection is to be able to spot the disease at the very earliest stage, when it is most easy to cure.</p>\n        <p>Blood tests are also being trialled to see if they can diagnose a whole range of cancers.</p>\n        <p>More than 140,000 volunteers aged 50-77 have been recruited across England to see if the test could pick up more than 50 types of tumours, most of which have no screening programmes.</p>\n        <p>The NHS-Galleri trial is made by Californian company Grail, and some interim results are due early next year.</p>\n        "

Signals from these are then relayed directly to the limbic system, a brain region that is associated with memory and emotions.</p>\n             <p>The Swedish researchers suggest that human body odour might communicate our emotional state - happy or anxious, for instance - and even elicit similar responses in others who smell it.</p>\n             <p>They asked volunteers to donate armpit sweat from when they were watching either a scary movie or a happy one.</p>\n             <p>Next, 48 women with social anxiety agreed to sniff some of these samples, alongside receiving a more conventional therapy called mindfulness, where people are encouraged to focus on the here and now rather than replaying negative thoughts.</p>\n             <p>Some of the women were given genuine body odour to sniff, while others - the control group - were given clean air instead.</p>\n             <p>Those who were exposed to the sweat appeared to do better with the therapy.</p>\n             <p>Lead researcher Ms Elisa Vigna, of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said: \"Sweat produced while someone was happy had the same effect as someone who had been scared by a movie clip. So there may be something about human chemo-signals in sweat generally which affects the response to treatment.</p>\n             <p>\"It may be that simply being exposed to the presence of someone else has this effect, but we need to confirm this. In fact, that is what we are testing now in a follow-up study with a similar design, but where we are also including sweat from individuals watching emotionally neutral documentaries.\"</p>\n             <h3>What is sweat and does it always smell?</h3>\n             <p>Most of the skin's sweat is odourless. But sweat glands in the armpit and groin produce certain compounds that cause body odour.</p>\n            <p>Bacteria on the skin's surface and on nearby hair follicles break down these compounds, producing others which are responsible for the smell.</p>\n            <p>Duncan Boak from the charity Fifth Sense, which aims to raise awareness about smell and taste disorders, said: \"We know there's a strong link between our sense of smell and our emotional wellbeing.</p>\n            <p>\"Losing the ability to smell other people, such as your partner and children can cause depression and feelings of isolation.</p>\n            <p>\"Whilst this is a preliminary study and further work is of course needed, it's very encouraging to see further research around the importance of our sense of smell to good mental health.\"</p>\n            "
